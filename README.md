# My-Planner-app

My Planner app is a prototype of trello app. It has its own authentication module to sign up the user and the authenticate the user using the login.
That means in order to use My planner app, user need to signup and then login using the credentials which will route him/her to the home page of the app, from where the boards can be accessed.

As soon as the user logs in he/she is routed to the home page of the app which consists of two sections: Your boards and Shared boards.
If it is a new user, the app checks if a board is already created by the user else it prompts the user to create a board. Your board consists of the board created by the user.
