# My-Planner-app

My Planner app is a prototype of the trello app. My planner has its own authentication module to sign up the user and the authenticate the user using the login.
That means in order to use My palnner app, you need to signup and then login using the your credentials which will route you to the home page of the app, from where you can access the boards. 
The user when creates a board it is generated in the your boards section and when someone else createsa board it gets reflected in your shared boards category.
