# My-Planner-app

My Planner app is a prototype of the trello app. My planner has its own authentication module to sign up the user and the authenticate the user using the login.
That means in order to create the account you need to signup and the login using the same mechanism. It will route you to the boards page where you will fing two boards that are your boards and shared boards.
The user when creates a board it is generated in the your boards section and when someone else createsa board it gets reflected in your shared boards category.
